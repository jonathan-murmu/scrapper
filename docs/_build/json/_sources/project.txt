Scrapper
========

Web Scrapping is a computer software technique of extracting information from websites. Usually, such software programs simulate human exploration of the World Wide Web by either implementing low-level Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), or embedding a fully-fledged web browser, such as Mozilla Firefox. Web scraping focuses more on the transformation of unstructured data on the web, typically in HTML format, into structured data that can be stored and analyzed in a central local database or spreadsheet. 

Uses of web scraping include online price comparison, contact scraping, weather data monitoring, website change detection, research, web mashup and web data integration. 

This web application is built using Django framework, it allows the user to scrap any type of product from either “flipkart.com” or “amazon.in” and store the result in the database. Then later the user can search the product from his dashboard and view the products. The user can also filter the result based on price, or site preference (flipkart or amazon). The user can also buy the product from the site. A choice is given to user to either buy the product from the site itself or from the originator site (flipkart or amazon).
